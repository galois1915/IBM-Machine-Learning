# Dep Learning and Reinforcement Learning
This course introduces you to two of the most sought-after disciplines in Machine Learning: Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that has applications in both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and is frequently used to power most of the AI applications that we use on a daily basis. First you will learn about the theory behind Neural Networks, which are the basis of Deep Learning, as well as several modern architectures of Deep Learning. Once you have developed a few  Deep Learning models, the course will focus on Reinforcement Learning, a type of Machine Learning that has caught up more attention recently. Although currently Reinforcement Learning has only a few practical applications, it is a promising area of research in AI that might become relevant in the near future.

## Module 7: Autencoders
In this module you become familiar with Autoencoders, an useful application of Deep Learning for Unsupervised Learning. Autoencoders are a neural network architecture that forces the learning of a lower dimensional representation of data, commonly images. In this module you will learn some Deep learning-based techniques for data representation, how autoencoders work, and to describe the use of trained autoencoders for image applications
Learning Objectives
- Explain the theory behind autoencoders
- Gain understanding on best practices for developing Autoencoders
- Gain practice using Keras and sklearn for Autoencoders applications

## Module 8: Generative Models and Applications of Deep Learning
In this module, you will learn about two types of generative models, which are **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. We will look at the theory behind each model and then implement them in Keras for generating artificial images. The goal is usually to generate images that are as realistic as possible. In the last lesson of this module, we will touch on additional topics in deep learning, namely using **Keras in a GPU environment** for speeding up model training.
Learning Objectives
- Understand the applications of GANs
Understand the differences between Autoencoders and VAEs
- Build and train generative models in Keras for different applications
- Describe the role of Generator and Discriminator in GANs
- Describe the working mechanics of GANs
- Gain understanding on best practices for developing VAEs
Gain practice of implementing VAEs in Keras
- Explain the theory behind Variational Autoencoders

## Module 9: Reinforcement Learning
In this module you become familiar with other novel applications of Neural Networks. You will learn about Generative Adversarial Networks, frequently referred to as GANs, which are an application of Neural Networks to generate new data. Finally, you learn about Reinforcement Learning, one of the big promises for A.I., based on training algorithms by using rewards, instead of using a method to minimize error, which is what we have been using throughout the course.
